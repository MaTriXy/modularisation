Welcome to **Billboard**, a repository that demonstrates a way to **modularise** an Android project.
This is my personal point of view on the subject and I'm sure there will be plenty of other valid approaches and opinions.
So please, take this code as it is: a particular way of thinking; and try to fit this approach into your own needs.
